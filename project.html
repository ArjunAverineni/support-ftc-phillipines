                <p class = "intro_page_text">Project Philippines is a student-led initiative born our robotics outreach event for the Our Lady of Joy Learning Center, a school in the Philippines 
                    where access to hands-on STEM education was ery limited. What began as a workshop introducing kids to motors, sensors, and basic engineering through simple kits gave birth to a 
                    full-fledged mission: to establish the nation‚Äôs first-ever FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics team. After witnessing the students‚Äô creativity, drive, and hunger to learn, 
                    the team behind Project Philippines committed to building sustainable opportunities‚Äînot just through kits and coding lessons, but by creating a platform for mentorship, 
                    international collaboration, and competitive robotics. The goal is to empower Filipino youth with skills that transcend borders, unlock new career paths, and give them a 
                    seat at the global innovation table. Every robot built, every workshop held, and every dollar raised moves this project closer to redefining what‚Äôs possible for young minds 
                    in underserved communities.</p>

                <p class = "intro_page_text">The heart of this initiative is guiding students through the full scope of the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)‚Äîa globally recognized robotics competition 
                    that emphasizes innovation, teamwork, and engineering skill. Our mentorship covers everything from CAD and robot design to programming with Java and documenting their progress. 
                    The ultimate goal is to empower the team not just to build a functioning robot, but to compete proudly in an international FTC tournament in Vietnam. Funds raised through our 
                    campaign and partnerships go directly toward making this possible. Every donation helps cover mentorship sessions, team registration fees, travel costs, robot kits, and field 
                    components. We ensure that the students have the tools they need and the support to use them effectively. Part of the funding also covers laptops for programming, learning 
                    materials, and internet access for virtual collaboration. By supporting Project Philippines, you're enabling more than just classroom learning‚Äîyou‚Äôre helping students access 
                    global opportunities, build career-defining skills, and become leaders in the next generation of STEM. This is a long-term investment in creating sustainable programs that will 
                    extend beyond this first team, opening doors for other schools across the region to follow.</p>
