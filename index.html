                    by establishing the first-ever FTC team in the country. Through our outreach, we have already introduced hundreds of elementary, middle, and high school 
                    students to hands-on robotics and the values of FIRST. With your support, we will build on this momentum by providing resources, mentorship, and opportunities 
                    that empower these students to compete, innovate, and inspire their communities through robotics. Together, we can open doors for the next generation of Filipino 
                    engineers, programmers, and changemakers.</p>
